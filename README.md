# Atlas Lab HR Analytics in POWER BI
We use the Kimball model approach to develop a Power BI report on HR analytics using a fictional company dataset, Atlas Labs.



## Project Goals : 

- The primary goal is to monitor the key HR metrics on employees.
- The secondary goal is to understand what factors impact attrition. 


## Atlas Lab Dataset Overview :
The database model follows the snowflake schema, making it more granular for our analysis. Refer the details given below for the metadata.

## Reporting Process :

- Requirements Gathering
- Connecting to Datasets 
- Building Data Models 
- Create DAX Measures


## Reporting Process Overview : 

Creating report to track HR Analytics : 
- End-to-End Development Process:
- Loaded four dimension tables and one fact table into Power BI Desktop
- Created data models to streamline the analysis process
- Modeling steps included:
- Creating a calculated date table
- Connecting all dimension tables to their respective fact or dimension tables to establish logical relationships in the data model
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and created new measures to calculate the attrition rate at Atlas Labs
- The attrition rate formula:
       Attrition Rate = (Number of Employees Who Left / Total Number of Employees) Ã— 100"

## Pre-Processing and creating the Data Models: 

- Firstly, We load our datasets into Power BI desktop and create relations between them. Decide and classify the existing tables as dimensions and facts. 

- Load the datasets and check for any formatting errors or missing values and if the columns are determined with the right datatype. 

- In this scenario, we only have one facts table which is Performance Rating and the rest are classified as dimensions. 

- Connect different data tables together in the form of snowflake schema using active and inactive relationships to attain the logical flow and connections in the datamodel.

- Based on our requirements, We activate the relations between dimension tables.

- DATA MODELS: We create a calculated Date table using the DAX code and connect it to the Employee table.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

- Our main objective is to understand attrition at the company.
- We begin the analysis by examining high-level metrics to understand employee trends related to attrition.
- A new measures folder was created to organize all the measures developed during the reporting process.
- Identified active and inactive employees using Employee[Attrition] and calculated the attrition rate.

- Attrition rate based on the previous measures.

- Identify the hiring trends over time to identify where we can identify the biggest growth in new employees.

- Analyze, How the employees are working within each department and what is the job role that each department is commonly hiring.

## The Role of Demographics and Their Impact on Performance

- Histogram sorts the employees by age. We create the age bins for our histogram using Power Query 

- We modify the histogram, to understand the data distribution across multiple Age bins and Gender

- Filter the visual to understand the status of the employee. (We add a page-level filter)

- Marital Status and Ethnicity: We calculate the average salary of the employees based on their ethnicity

<img width="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed9489f-f67b-4d8b-9dd7-dbd0b8abcdb6">

- Track individual employee's performances scores based on their yearly performance reviews and individual performance reviews. 

## Insights discovered

Key Insights discovered 

- Total Attrition Rate: 16.1%.  
- The Sales department has the highest attrition rate, as Sales Representatives are more prone to churn with a 39.8% attrition rate.
- Employees who have to travel frequently have the highest attrition rate, 24.9%. 
- Employees with longer tenure are less likely to leave their companies.
